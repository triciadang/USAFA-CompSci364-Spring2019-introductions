===================
First and Last Name
===================

The first paragraph (or even a couple of paragraphs) should be a biographical
sketch about yourself. How would you introduce yourself to someone? What should
they know about you? You might highlight some of your personal accomplishments
and experiences that have shaped your life.

This file is formatted using reStructured Text (RST), a lightweight markup
language that is easily readable. Various software development tools, including
GitHub, will render this file as an HTML document when it appears in a
repository. A primer for using reStructured Text is available online:
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html>.

Finally, a biographical sketch wouldn't be complete without a picture. Please
include one that is clearly recognizable, preferably a head-and-shoulders shot.
If you don't have one immediately available, a selfie works. Use the following
to include the image in the rendered Markdown file::

    .. image:: path/to/image

(but not indented because that's used to denote a code block). In a perfect
world, your image should be approximately 1 megapixel and less than 200 KB in
size, but that's not particularly critical in this case. If linked correctly,
you should see your image when this file is rendered on GitHub.
